        <h3>i do Sketch normally</h3>
        <p>Sketch, traditionally a rough drawing or painting in which an artist notes down his preliminary ideas for a work that will eventually be realized with greater precision and detail. The term also applies to brief creative pieces that per se may have artistic merit.</p>

          <p>My counsel was always the same. I attempt to assuage their worry and self doubt. I say: “An unsent application is a guaranteed rejection.” Or I tell them one of my personal beliefs: “Real success is only possible from a position that risks failure.”</p>

        <p>I’ve applied to Google, Microsoft, Amazon (multiple times), and some local companies in the Seattle area. I’d apply at Facebook, but I don’t have an account, so that might be a non-starter (I admire Facebook and their vision, but I’ve chosen not to have an account so I can’t post stupid things that might have an impact on my security clearance).</p>

          Unfortunately, learning how to design webpages using drag-and-drop and static HTML pages is no longer enough. To be competitive today, students need to know the foundation of HTML, but they also need to be fluent in a server-side language such as PHP. The problem is the old methods and tools do not work well when trying to prepare students for the real world, or teach them PHP.</p>
